## Project Aims

### The Scenario:

**The Challenge:** Rainforest Retail have difficulty managing their employee details & schedules, recently transitioning from tedious paperwork to a flashy website.

* As more employees are added it becomes harder to get an overview of availabilty and where everyone is working on a given day

* Keeping employee records up to date is time-consuming and error-prone.

**The Solution:** Madame Papier will create an efficient HR scheduling system: Schedulism to tackle this challenge Rainforest Retail have been facing. This will improve employee schedules & requests as well as provide a much more seamless system for the team.

### For Users:
* Implement an electronic calendar system for employees to view & request shifts.
* Provide extensive & comprehensive training to all staff for the app functionalities before the launch of the system.
* Create a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
* Comply with security regulations & protocols to protect confidential employee data.
* Allow separate access controls to employees & HR employees.
